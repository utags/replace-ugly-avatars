## Application Scenarios

This script has a variety of practical application scenarios. Here are the details for you:

- **Enhance Visual Experience**: When you find someone's profile picture 🤡 extremely unpleasant, you can use this script to replace it with a harmless one 🥸, instantly making your visual experience more comfortable.
- **Express Your Attitude**: If someone's remarks are always stupid and disgusting, you can give them a 🐷 pig - head profile picture. Then, when you see them again, you can simply skip over them and avoid the annoyance.
- **Avoid Distraction**: In various situations, there are always some "slackers" with very familiar profile pictures that unconsciously draw your attention. By changing their profile pictures, you can forcefully create a sense of unfamiliarity and effectively distract your attention.
- **Reduce Interference**: Some platforms are filled with a large number of "momo" profile pictures or those with political associations, which can easily interfere with you. Use this script to randomly change their profile pictures and free yourself from such interference (more websites will be supported in the future).
- **Meet the Needs of OCD**: If you have obsessive - compulsive disorder and want all profile pictures to have a unified style, this script can easily fulfill your wish.
- **Kill Boredom**: When you're bored, you can use the script to continuously change profile pictures 🔃, killing time and adding a bit of fun in the process.
